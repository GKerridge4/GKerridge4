## I'm George!

I'm pretty new to GitHub. I come from a music background with lots of live and studio experience. But since Covid I have decided to make a career alteration down a more technology based route. So far, I love this community and I can't wait to get involved with more!

- 🌱 Currently I am on a **Software Engineering** bootcamp with [HyperionDev](https://www.hyperiondev.com/).
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate, help and work with anything ***Music, Art, Creativity*** related projects.
- 💬 Feel free to ask me about **Ableton Live 10**. It is my main DAW workhorse for live performances.
- 🎸 I currently work with **[Caswell](https://www.instagram.com/caswellofficial/)** as a *Bassist* and *Ableton Programmer*
